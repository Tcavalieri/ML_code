# ML_code

This repository contains pythons files for the application of a basic ML pipeline.
The Python files are in the LinearRegression_example:

- InputReader.py (class for reading input file as *.yml file)
- FeaturesExtraction.py (class for features and labels extraction)
- Models.py (class for implementation fo ML models)
- Trainer.py (class containing different training algorithms)
- Logger.py (class for the output of a log file)
- program.py (main file for the execution of the pipeline)

It also contain in the same directory a set of data for testing purposes and an input file.

As chematic of the ML code architecture is presented below:
